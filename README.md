Todo:
-------------
Done - 1. Why a task runner?
Done - 2. What is grunt.js?

3. Automating development tasks
  - starting node server, and launching window
  - watch for changes and running tasks
  - Reloading browser after running tasks
  - sass/less to css
  - linting
  - running unit tests
  **Show example of watch, change scss and show output in console and update in browser**

4. Automating production build tasks
  - compilation and minification (CSS, JS, templates)
  - pre-commit pass/fail tests based on linting and unit test success
  - image optimization
  **Show example, show console after running "grunt dist" and load dist/index.html**

5. Closing comments and personal experience with Grunt and using automation, maybe show Tim the toolman grunting clip (the one where he grunts and says yes yes)
